# Image Processing
------
In this Repository I will demonstrates how can one apply various image pre-processing & image post-processing techniques in MATLAB environment. A digital image consists of picture elements, commonly known as pixels, where each pixel has a finite and discrete numerical representation for its intensity or gray level. These numerical values are generated from the output of two-dimensional functions, with the spatial coordinates denoted by x and y along the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.
